#### You Could Check what I wrote details about this project [HERE](https://giddy-scooter-aaa.notion.site/Cat-Detection-with-YOLO-V1-Implementation-1e60ee53bf2d427a9ce29d9756f1703e)

#### 1️⃣ I completed this project last year (2021). This Writing is to reorganize What I had done.

#### 2️⃣ Moreover, 🎇 means I could not be able to upload here as their file size is toooo big but you would be able to download them in [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Seongwoong-sk/Yolo_V1_TF2/blob/main/Yolo_v1_cat.ipynb) where there are links.
